Both collections are categorized as Statutorily Required (SR) because they are directly necessary for the NCUA to fulfill its core statutory mandate under the Federal Credit Union Act (FCUA) to ensure the safety and soundness of federally insured credit unions.\\n\\n**Justification for SR Categorization:**\\n\\nThe **Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. § 1751 et seq.)** establishes the NCUA and grants it broad authority to regulate federal credit unions and to ensure the safety and soundness of the credit union system. Specifically, 12 U.S.C. § 1766(a) empowers the NCUA Board to prescribe rules and regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of the FCUA, including those related to safety and soundness. Furthermore, 12 U.S.C. § 1786 outlines the NCUA's examination and enforcement powers, which necessitate the collection of information to effectively monitor and supervise credit unions. The information collections described in this notice are integral to the NCUA's exercise of these fundamental statutory responsibilities.\\n\\n1.  **NCUA Template—Large Credit Union Data Collection (OMB Number: 3133-0209):** This collection is directly linked to 12 CFR part 702, subpart C, 'Capital Planning and Stress Testing,' which applies to federally insured credit unions with $10 billion or more in assets. The regulation text explicitly states that the data collected is 'needed to evaluate their internal assessments of capital adequacy and to ensure their capital resources are sufficient.' Capital adequacy and stress testing are fundamental components of prudential supervision, directly supporting the NCUA's statutory mandate to ensure the safety and soundness of large, complex credit unions. While the Dodd-Frank Act (specifically Section 165, 12 U.S.C. § 5365) established stress testing requirements for large banking organizations, the NCUA's adoption of similar requirements for large credit unions falls squarely within its general safety and soundness authority under the FCUA, making the associated data collection statutorily required for effective oversight and risk management.\\n\\n2.  **Subordinated Debt, 12 CFR part 702, subpart D (OMB Number: 3133-0207):** This collection pertains to a rule that permits certain credit unions (LICUs, Complex Credit Unions, and New Credit Unions) to issue subordinated debt for regulatory capital treatment. The regulation text explicitly cites the 'borrowing authority granted to FCUs by the FCU Act' (12 U.S.C. § 1757(9)) and FCUs' 'statutory authority to enter into contracts and exercise incidental powers' (12 U.S.C. § 1757(17)) as the legal basis for FCUs to incur indebtedness. While the issuance of subordinated debt is a voluntary activity for credit unions, the NCUA's oversight, including the collection of information regarding 'requirements in respect of the Subordinated Debt and Subordinated Debt Note, disclosures and offering materials, repayment... and regulatory capital treatment,' is essential for the agency to properly administer this permitted activity and ensure it aligns with safety and soundness principles. Without this information, the NCUA could not effectively monitor the impact of such debt on credit union capital and risk profiles, which is a core aspect of its statutory supervisory role.\\n\\n**Justification for Reform Recommendations:**\\n\\nGiven that both information collections are categorized as SR, outright deletion is not feasible as it would directly impede the NCUA's ability to fulfill its statutory mandate to ensure the safety and soundness of the credit union system. Therefore, the reform recommendations focus on enhancing efficiency, reducing burden on respondents, and improving the utility and clarity of the collected information while maintaining or strengthening regulatory effectiveness. Simplification ensures that only truly necessary data is collected, minimizing unnecessary reporting. Harmonization reduces unique compliance burdens by aligning with broader industry standards where appropriate, fostering consistency across the financial sector. Modernization leverages technology to streamline reporting processes, benefiting both the agency and the regulated entities by improving data quality and reducing administrative overhead. These recommendations directly address the Paperwork Reduction Act's goals of minimizing burden and maximizing the practical utility of information collections, as well as the general call for public comments within the notice itself.\"\n}\n```",
