The regulation text explicitly states it is 'pursuant to public law' and 'published to comply with the aforesaid requirement.' It directly cites the 'Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984 (Title I, Pub. L. 98-373)' as providing the authority. Specifically, Section 103(b)(2) of the Act (15 U.S.C. ยง 4102(b)(2)) mandates that 'Any vacancy occurring in the membership of the Commission shall be filled, after notice of the vacancy is published in the Federal Register.' Therefore, the publication of this notice is a direct, non-discretionary requirement of federal statute. Reform recommendations are limited because the regulation merely fulfills a precise statutory mandate for public transparency in commission appointments.\"\n  }\n]\n```",
