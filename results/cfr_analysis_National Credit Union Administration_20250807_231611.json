The regulation establishes \nprocedures for collecting information from credit unions regarding their operations and compliance.\n\nThe statutory authority exists under 44 U.S.C. ยง 3501 et seq. and 12 U.S.C. ยง 1751 et seq., but the \nspecific collection methods and requirements are agency-determined rather than congressionally mandated. \nThis provides opportunity for streamlining and modernization without compromising regulatory oversight.\n\nReform recommendations focus on reducing compliance burden while maintaining necessary oversight, \nparticularly through electronic systems and harmonization with other regulators' requirements.",
