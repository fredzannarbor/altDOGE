It waives specific requirements in 34 CFR 75.261(c)(2) of the Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) to allow current LINCS grantees to continue receiving federal funding beyond their original performance period. The authority for this waiver is explicitly granted by 20 U.S.C. 9295, which permits the NIFL Director to waive EDGAR provisions deemed unnecessary for the administration of the title. \\n\\nThe regulation is categorized as NRAN (Not Required but Agency Needs) because while the waiver itself is not statutorily *required* (the statute *permits* it), it was deemed *necessary* for agency operations. The stated purpose is to 'avoid a lapse in the availability of services provided by current LINCS grantees' due to legislative uncertainty surrounding NIFL's future funding and the reauthorization of the Workforce Investment Act. This demonstrates a clear operational need to maintain critical program services during a period of transition and uncertainty. \\n\\nReform recommendations focus on the systemic issues that necessitate such waivers. Modernizing legislative frameworks to include clearer provisions for program continuity during reauthorization periods would provide greater stability for grantees and beneficiaries, reducing reliance on ad-hoc waivers. Harmonizing general administrative regulations with specific program needs could also streamline operations and reduce the administrative burden of frequent waiver requests.\"\n  }\n]\n```",

Specifically, Section 511(a)(1) of WIOA repealed subtitle C of title II of WIA, which included Section 242 (20 U.S.C. 9252) that authorized the National Institute for Literacy and its Advisory Board. Consequently, the National Institute for Literacy and its Advisory Board ceased to exist. This renders any regulations, notices, or operational requirements pertaining to this defunct entity obsolete. The primary recommendation is the deletion or formal obsoletion of any such regulatory text from the Code of Federal Regulations or agency guidance to reflect the current statutory landscape and prevent confusion regarding non-existent entities.\"\n  }\n]\n```",
