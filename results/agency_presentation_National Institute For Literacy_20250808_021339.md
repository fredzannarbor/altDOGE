# CFR Document Analysis Summary
## National Institute For Literacy

### Agency Overview
The National Institute For Literacy (NIFL) was established by the National Literacy Act of 1991, operating as an independent federal entity within the Department of Education. Its mission was to provide national leadership, research, and technical assistance to enhance adult literacy and coordinate federal efforts. NIFL aimed to improve literacy instruction, disseminate best practices, and support professional development for educators. However, NIFL was effectively dissolved around 2012-2013, with its functions absorbed into the Department of Education's Office of Career, Technical, and Adult Education (OCTAE). Therefore, its primary challenge in today's Washington political environment is its non-existence as a distinct agency, reflecting a shift in federal literacy program administration.
