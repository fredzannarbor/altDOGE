It is not statutorily *required* for NIFL to issue this waiver. However, it is *needed for agency operations* (NRAN) to ensure the continuity of critical Literacy Information and Communication (LINCS) services, which are mandated by 20 U.S.C. 9252(c)(1)(A). Due to pending Congressional reauthorization of the Workforce Investment Act and uncertainty regarding NIFL's future funding and structure, the agency determined that holding new grant competitions was not in the public interest. The waiver of 34 CFR 75.261(c)(2) allowed NIFL to continue funding existing LINCS grantees with FY 2009 funds, preventing a lapse in essential services and maintaining operational stability during a period of legislative transition. The authority for such waivers is provided under 20 U.S.C. 9295. The reform recommendations focus on addressing the systemic issues that necessitated this waiver, rather than the waiver notice itself, which is a temporary administrative action. By modernizing legislative frameworks and harmonizing grant regulations, the need for such ad-hoc waivers could be reduced, leading to more efficient and predictable program administration.\"\n  }\n]\n```",

Furthermore, the justification for holding the meeting in a closed session is directly derived from specific exemptions (2 and 6) of the Government in the Sunshine Act (5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(2) and (6)). Therefore, the entire regulatory action, including the notice and its specific details, is directly tied to and required by statutory language. The primary reform recommendation is deletion because the National Institute for Literacy and its Advisory Board were subsequently terminated by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) of 2014. This legislative change eliminated the statutory basis for the board's existence, thereby rendering any associated meeting notices and their regulatory requirements obsolete.
