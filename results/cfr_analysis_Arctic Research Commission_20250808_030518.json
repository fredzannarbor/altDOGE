The regulation text explicitly states, 'Notice is hereby given, pursuant to public law, which states that any vacancy occurring in the membership of the Commission shall be filled, after notice of the vacancy is published in the Federal Register.' It further clarifies, 'This notice is published to comply with the aforesaid requirement.' This direct mandate is found in the Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-373), specifically 15 U.S.C. ยง 4102(b)(2), which states: 'Any vacancy occurring in the membership of the Commission shall be filled, after notice of the vacancy is published in the Federal Register.' Given this clear statutory 'shall' clause, the agency has no discretion to omit or substantially alter the requirement for this notice. The current notice is already streamlined and efficient, making significant simplification difficult without undermining its statutory purpose. Recommendations for reform primarily focus on potential future legislative changes to allow for more modern notification methods, rather than changes to the current regulatory action which is a direct fulfillment of a statutory mandate.\"\n  }\n]\n```",
