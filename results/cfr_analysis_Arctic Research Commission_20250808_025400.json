The regulation directly cites the 'Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984 (Title I, Pub. L. 98-373)' as providing the authority for this notice. This clear and direct statutory mandate for Federal Register publication of vacancies makes this a non-discretionary requirement essential for the legal operation and staffing of the Arctic Research Commission.\"\n  }\n]\n```",
