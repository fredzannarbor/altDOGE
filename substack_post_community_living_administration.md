# Breaking: Here is where DOGE is going next

I wrote a program that used LLMs to analyze 485 Federal Register documents from the Community Living Administration (CLA), the federal agency responsible for helping seniors and people with disabilities live independently in their communities. Using the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) criteria framework, I processed every single rule in just over 2 hours.

The findings reveal that **375 of the 485 documents (77%) are Statutorily Required**, primarily driven by laws like the Paperwork Reduction Act and Older Americans Act. **However**, by the same token, 110 aren't.  The DOGE-style analysis identified critical reform opportunities across five key areas: streamlining duplicative data collection requirements, harmonizing reporting across ACL programs and other federal agencies, modernizing processes through APIs and automated systems, enhancing transparency in grant award notices, and conducting comprehensive burden assessments to shift toward outcome-based reporting. I was able to identify a set of "vulnerable rules" that lack explicit statutory mandates and are prime targets for eliminationâ€”including discretionary Adult Protective Services standards and funding programs that rely on broad authority rather than specific congressional direction.

This analysis represents exactly the kind of systematic, evidence-based, synoptic approach that **everyone** -- not just DOGE needs -- to bring to government reform. By enabling **anyone** to prepare an AI analysis strategy running against the same data, we can level the playing field.
