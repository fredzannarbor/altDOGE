# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a script that retrieves the number of documents available for each of the 466 agencies listed in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The script will interact with the Federal Register API to gather document counts and provide a comprehensive report of agency document availability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a regulatory analyst, I want to retrieve document counts for all CFR agencies, so that I can analyze the regulatory activity across different government agencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script is executed THEN the system SHALL retrieve a list of all 466 agencies from the CFR
2. WHEN an agency list is obtained THEN the system SHALL query the Federal Register API for document counts for each agency
3. WHEN API queries are made THEN the system SHALL handle rate limiting and API errors gracefully
4. WHEN document counts are retrieved THEN the system SHALL store the results in a structured format (CSV or JSON)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data consumer, I want the script to provide detailed output, so that I can understand which agencies have the most regulatory documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script completes THEN the system SHALL output agency names and their corresponding document counts
2. WHEN results are generated THEN the system SHALL include metadata such as query date and total agencies processed
3. WHEN agencies have zero documents THEN the system SHALL still include them in the output with a count of 0
4. WHEN the script encounters API errors for specific agencies THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue processing other agencies

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the script to be robust and maintainable, so that it can be run reliably and updated as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script is designed THEN the system SHALL include proper error handling for network failures
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff
3. WHEN the script runs THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators for long-running operations
4. WHEN the script completes THEN the system SHALL generate a summary report of successful and failed queries

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the script to be configurable, so that I can adjust parameters without modifying the code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script is executed THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of output format (CSV, JSON, or both)
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of request delays and retry attempts
3. WHEN output is generated THEN the system SHALL allow specification of output file paths
4. WHEN the script runs THEN the system SHALL support verbose logging modes for debugging
